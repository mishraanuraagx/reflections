When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
whenever something new and additional worth saving addedd to the local repo
git remote = to see all known remote git repo on github
git remove -v
git remote add origin linkhttp = provide git a remote repo with link, with local name to that repo origin for easier access
git push origin master = where to push n which branchname

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
doing it manually means we keeps repo's update to with relevant update and which may have effect on remaining repos for other contributors. Also it adds exra overhead for automatic update and we would need costant internet conection for that.

remember to cd into to the dir else u wont see the desired result for 'git remote -v' output
