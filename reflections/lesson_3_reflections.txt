When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
whenever something new and additional worth saving addedd to the local repo
git remote = to see all known remote git repo on github
git remove -v
git remote add origin linkhttp = provide git a remote repo with link, with local name to that repo origin for easier access
git push origin master = where to push n which branchname
